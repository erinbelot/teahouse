Hello!

I started this challenge view first, simply because I think about things more visually than abstractly and for me it's a really good way to break down elements  into their components.

I'm still finding my feet design wise and I've had a lot of fun copying website designs in the past so I thought I'd find a marketplace style I like and copy that. (Also saves on time!).

This is all the elements on the page, I'm using big garish body colors for the classes so it's easy to see what's what. Next step is to refine everything and move it all about into the right spots.
